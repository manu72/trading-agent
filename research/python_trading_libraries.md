## Implementation Considerations

1. For momentum strategies:
   - Need libraries that can calculate relative strength indicators
   - Require efficient data handling for multiple securities
   - Should support ranking and sorting of assets based on momentum metrics

2. For sector rotation:
   - Need access to sector ETF data or sector indices
   - Require tools for comparing sector performance
   - Should support periodic rebalancing based on momentum rankings

3. For AI integration:
   - Need libraries that can process market data for pattern recognition
   - Require tools for feature engineering from financial data
   - Should support model training, validation, and deployment

4. For risk management:
   - Need libraries for position sizing calculations
   - Require tools for implementing stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms
   - Should support portfolio-level risk metrics
